# How to use these files

Take your preferred mission file from `missions` folder and copy template files from `template` to the mission folder. The alternative way is to download and unpack the latest PBO from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz0gHeKbXhWAM3c4UG92VWM0Qzg).

Further instructions on how to work with the templates can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13cg70RRwFfINgi8mzk9OfgqMrwiTkY6NRTTx97iONeQ/edit).
